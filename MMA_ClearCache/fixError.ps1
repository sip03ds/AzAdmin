.SYNOPSIS
Script to clear the Microsoft Monitoring Cache and remove the hybrid worker configuration from the registry.

.DESCRIPTION
This script is intended to be run from PowerShell. 
If a VM is enabled for Update Management in Azure Automation and is migrated to Azure it somehow gets corrupted (in my experience)
Use this script to: Fix "Update management is not enabled on this machine error" (while it was already enabled in the past)
Use this script to: Clear the Hybrid worker configuration
After running the script the configuration will be downloaded automatically from the required resources.
